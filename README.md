Iâ€™m a 4th-year undergraduate student with a strong foundation in IT and a growing focus on cybersecurity. My experience spans technical support, network administration, and security automation, which has shaped my interest in defending systems against real-world threats. I enjoy investigating problems, identifying patterns, and implementing practical solutions that improve security posture.

## Objective

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst. My goal is to build expertise in threat detection, incident response, and network defense while growing into a security professional who strengthens organizational resilience against evolving cyber threats.
